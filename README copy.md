# Bruker-to-Numpy
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for loading and converting Bruker NMR data into NumPy arrays for further processing and analysis in Python.
The notebooks cover both time-domain and frequency-domain NMR data for 1D and 2D experiments.

### Time-Domain Data (Bruker NMR)
`fid.ipynb` Loads and processes 1D time-domain (FID) data from Bruker experiments.

`ser.ipynb` Loads and processes 2D time-domain (SER) data from Bruker experiments.
### Frequency-Domain Data (Bruker NMR)
`freq_domain_1d.ipynb` Loads and processes 1D frequency-domain Bruker NMR data.

Example HSQC data used in the notebooks is taken from the Human Metabolome Database(HMDB).
